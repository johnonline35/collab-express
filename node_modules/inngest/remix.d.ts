/**
 * In Remix, serve and register any declared functions with Inngest, making them
 * available to be triggered by events.
 *
 * Remix requires that you export both a "loader" for serving `GET` requests,
 * and an "action" for serving other requests, therefore exporting both is
 * required.
 *
 * See {@link https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/resource-routes}
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { serve } from "inngest/remix";
 * import fns from "~/inngest";
 *
 * const handler = serve("My Remix App", fns);
 *
 * export { handler as loader, handler as action };
 * ```
