/**
 * In an edge runtime, serve and register any declared functions with Inngest,
 * making them available to be triggered by events.
 *
 * The edge runtime is a generic term for any serverless runtime that supports
 * only standard Web APIs such as `fetch`, `Request`, and `Response`, such as
 * Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, and AWS Lambda@Edge.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { serve } from "inngest/edge";
 * import fns from "~/inngest";
 *
 * export const handler = serve("My Edge App", fns);
 * ```
